implementations through 1.0 have the following flaw:

The timer runs every 1-2 ms.
Then it checks for the enable trigger signal if it is low.
And then sampels the incoming signal for a given 4-16 times.
When the buffer is full the timer is stopped and the buffer is dumped over the serial.
At that point the timer continous.
And that can happen a couple of milliseconds after the trigger signal is already low.
But than it is still going to sample some samples and stops when the enable goes high,
and goes on the remaing couple of sample when the signal is low again, which will be too few samples.

A solution is to wait for the trigger to be high and go low when the buffer is dumped to serial.
Another solution is to attach a isr on change on the enable trigger and enable the timer in that isr.
Then the timer immedialtey fires and starts sampling.
The interrupts are disabled when dumping the buffer.
This solution is implemented in the controlled-experiment folder.
