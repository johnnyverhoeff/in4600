Parts used:
LED: LT-1501, https://www.led-tech.de/produkt-pdf/cree/xlamp_mce.pdf

FET: http://www.irf.com/product-info/datasheets/data/irl1004.pdf

Transistor: https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/2N3904.pdf

PSU: Voltcraft SPS 2500-5
It is rated at 12.5 Watts, which is less then is drawn.
Operating temp is up to 35 C, but is 40 C



Test method: 
Select the to be tested code, watch the meter for a minute or two.

Hot:
LED: 68 C
According to datasheet, the LED has only 87 % of luminous flux at this temp.

FET + transistor: 55 C
There are no temperature limitations for these semi-conductors at these temps.

PSU: 40 C
No datasheet with characteristics found.
